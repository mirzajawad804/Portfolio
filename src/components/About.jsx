            Hi! I’m Mirza Muhammad Jawad Ali Kazmi, a 14-year-old aspiring web
            developer. I’m passionate about coding and love creating websites
            and interactive applications. I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, and I’m exploring React to make dynamic, user-friendly
            web experiences. I enjoy learning by building real projects and
            experimenting with new ideas. My goal is to grow as a web developer,
            work on meaningful projects, and continue improving my skills while
            having fun in the process.
